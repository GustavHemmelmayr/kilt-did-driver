# DID method specification

## Method

The identifier for KILT Protocol's DID Method is `kilt`.
A KILT DID starts with `did:kilt:`.

It conforms with the [generic DID syntax](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/#generic-did-syntax).

## DID Method-specific identifier

The DID Method-specific identifier is an [ss58](<https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/wiki/External-Address-Format-(SS58)>) public address, generated by encoding the **signing** public key of a KILT Identity.

## Note

KILT DIDs are stored on the KILT Protocol blockchain that is public and by definition decentralized.

In this specification, we'll refer to the [KILT SDK](https://github.com/KILTprotocol/sdk-js) as a convenient tool to interact with the KILT blockchain. However, there is no technical constraint to use the KILT SDK for any DID-related operation.

## Operation: Create a DID and DID Document

### Create a DID

KILT Blockchain nodes implement a DID module, with an `add` function.
This function takes the following parameters:

- `owner`: the public ss58 address of the caller of the method.
- `sign_key`: the public signing key of the owner (= KILT identity corresponding to this DID).
- `box_key`: the public encryption key of the owner (= KILT identity corresponding to this DID).
- `doc_ref`: reference (URL) to the DID document.

The blockchain node verifies the transaction signature corresponding to the owner and inserts it to the blockchain storage by using a map:
`owner => (sign_key, box_key, doc_ref)`.

For convenience, a KILT DID can be created with the `Did.fromIdentity` function made available in the [KILT SDK](https://github.com/KILTprotocol/sdk-js).
The storage location for the associated DID Document should be specified (`documentStore` which will be used as `doc_ref`).

Example of a DID created via the KILT SDK, before encoding and storage:

```javascript
{
  identifier: 'did:kilt:5CDct4QDpQYfAVDrskNuiEdXyiE38oPfTHEJ65ZLSpz9WasE',
  publicBoxKey:
   '0xfb151a959ed0e01fd9748105c617497f329339ed22207b9185cc40c48b44e004',
  publicSigningKey:
   '0x245e26168c3393e9c7fce042637b980758e783840974f9fadce4c8fe6fc76cb9',
  documentStore: 'https://services.kilt.io:443/contacts/5CDct4QDpQYfAVDrskNuiEdXyiE38oPfTHEJ65ZLSpz9WasE'
}
```

### Create the associated DID Document

The KILT SDK offers a function `getDefaultDocument` to create a default DID Document for a given DID.

Writing the DID Document onto the previously specified `documentStore` is not enforced in the KILT protocol nor in the KILT SDK.

This can be done via a third-party service. One such example of a DID Document creation service can be found in this [demo](https://demo.kilt.io/dashboard).

### Proving control

Proving control of a DID means proving the **binding** between this DID and the DID Document that describes it.
As mentioned in the [DID specification](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/#proving-control-of-a-did-and-did-document), it is a two step process:

- Resolving the DID to a DID Document according to the KILT DID Method specification, as detailed below in "Operation: Read/Resolve";
- Verifying that the `id` property of the resulting DID Document matches the DID that was resolved.

## Operation: Read/Resolve a DID to a DID Document

In order to request a DID Document, its location must first be determined by querying the KILT blockchain for the DID entry.

For convenience, the KILT SDK functions `Did.queryByIdentifier` or `queryByAddress` can be used, and the returned DID object contains the `documentStore` as a property.
A standard HTTP/HTTPS fetch may be used to fetch `documentStore` and hence retrieve the associated DID Document. Other techniques might be used, depending on the storage location type.

## Operation: Update the DID Document

The DID Document can be updated on the storage that is specified as a DID storage location.
It must be ensured that the identity operating the update is authorized to do so, e.g. by making use of the `authentication` property in the DID Document.

## Operation: Deactivate

Deactivating a DID can be done by using the KILT blockchain's `remove` method on a DID.
This removes the document storage location property, effectively unlinking a DID from its DID Document.

For convenience, the KILT SDK function `Did.remove` can be used.

## Security and Privacy considerations

An identity that creates a DID also effectively controls the associated DID Document.
Hence the private key for this identity should be kept entirely private.
